<!-- META
The meta element from line 11 has character set that give associated data to the
browser about our code. charset="utf-8" tells the browser that all the code Below
are encoded with the utf-8 encoding system. This encoder translates what we type
to how it shows in browser. It is particularly importatnt to use the correct encoder
if we are visiting sites with lots of special character, like japanese website
for example. Changing the encoder to something else will ruin all the characters
and make the whole page meaningless.

utf-8 is the standard we have to use because it includes all the international
symbols and everything which are listed in the unicode character table and it
even include emojis. Here is their website: https://unicode-table.com/en/

Meta tags have more attributes than charset. All tells the borwser how it should
display the webpage and gives information about the content of the website.
 -->

<!-- Italicize in html.
When we want to make itallic text, we can use the element <i> </i> or <em> </em>
both visually does the same thing. However, i is simply change the text appearance,
whereas em put emphosise to it, showing the significance of the text we put in
itallic. Therefore, it is highly recommended that we use em instead of i! Similary
if we want to bold our text we can use the element <b> </b> or <strong> </strong>
The element strong is recommended over b for similar reason.
-->

<!-- HTML list
To make a list, we can use unordered list element as shown:
<ul>
  <li>first item</li>
  <li>second item</li>
  <li>third item</li>
</ul>

Ordered list is something like 1,2,3 or a,b,c ; not as simple as bullet points.
For using ordered list, we use the element as shown:
<ol>
  <li>Fee</li>
  <li>Fi</li>
  <li>Fo</li>
  <li>Fum</li>
</ol>

Note that on both elements, the attributes can be added. Search on mdn for more
details about their attributes.
